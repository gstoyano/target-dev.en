# [!DNL Target] for mobile apps FAQ

List of frequently asked questions about [!DNL Target] for mobile apps.

## Should I use tags in [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] to deploy the SDK, or can I deploy the SDK without using Launch?

The SDK is available on the [Adobe Marketing Cloud git](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/acp-sdks/). If you don't use [tags in Adobe Experience Platform](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/tags/home.html), you must manage your own settings file and manage it in your app. 

## Which SDKs are available today?

The Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDKs currently support iOS, Android, and React. For more information, see the [Adobe Experience Cloud Platform Mobile SDKs guide](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/).

## What is the frequency of the location-based feature, in terms of verification about the latitude and longitude?

See the [Adobe Places documentation](https://placesdocs.com/places-services-by-adobe-documentation/) for more information.

## Do I need at.js for the Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDKs to work?

No, you don't need at.js to use the mobile SDKs. at.js is the [!DNL Target] JavaScript library for websites. The Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDKs are for mobile apps.

## Is [!DNL Target] Mobile a functionality of [!DNL Adobe Target] Premium Product SKU only?

No. For [!DNL Adobe Target Standard] customers, you can use our Mobile SDKs for [!UICONTROL A/B Test] and [!UICONTROL Experience Targeting] (XT) activities only with the [!DNL Target Standard] Mobile App add-on. If you want to use [!UICONTROL Recommendations] or AI-powered features in the mobile app, you need an [Adobe Target Premium](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/introduction/intro.html#premium) license.

## Is there a mobile app integration between [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] (AEM) and [!DNL Target] mobile activities?

Currently, you can share JSON [Experience Fragments](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/experiences/offers/aem-experience-fragments.html) from AEM to Targ[!DNL ]et and there might be potential to then use them in a mobile app activity.
