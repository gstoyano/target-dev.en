# Implement [!DNL Target] using [!DNL Dynamic Tag Manager] (DTM)

[!DNL Adobe Dynamic Tag Manager] is a legacy product and is no longer supported. For the best implementation experience, [!DNL Adobe] recommends using tags in [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform].

Tags in [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] are the next generation of tag management capabilities from [!DNL Adobe]. Tags give customers a simple way to deploy and manage the analytics, marketing, and advertising tags necessary to power relevant customer experiences.
