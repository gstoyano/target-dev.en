# Use cloud-based instances with [!DNL Target]

Information about issues customers face when using cloud-based instances to test [!DNL Adobe Target].

[!DNL Target] customers sometimes use cloud-based instances with [!DNL Target] for testing or simple proof-of-concept purposes. These instances might include the following domains: 

`azurewebsites.net`, `cloudapp.net`, `amazonaws.com`, `cloudfront.net`, `herokuapp.com`, or `firebaseapp.com`

These domains, and many others, are part of the [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/list/public_suffix_list.dat).

**Issue:** Modern browsers won't save cookies if you are using these domains.

The at.js JavaScript library uses cookies to track users to ensure that [!DNL [!DNL Target]] always presents a consistent experience. If the [!DNL Target] JavaScript library can't save cookies, Target requests are disabled.

**Solution:** As best practice, if you intend to use cloud-based instances with domains included on the Public Suffix List, make sure that you customize the `cookieDomain` setting. For more information, see [targetGlobalSettings()](/help/dev/implement/client-side/atjs/atjs-functions/targetglobalsettings.md).
