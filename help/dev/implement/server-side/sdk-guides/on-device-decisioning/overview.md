# On-device decisioning overview

The next-generation [!DNL Adobe Target] SDKs now offer [!UICONTROL on-device decisioning], which provides the ability to cache your A/B and Experience Targeting (XT) campaigns on your server and perform in-memory decisioning at near-zero latency, without blocking network requests to [!DNL Adobe Target]'s Edge Network.

[!DNL Adobe Target] also offers the flexibility of delivering the most relevant and up-to-date experience from your experimentation and ML-driven personalization campaigns via a live server call. In other words, when performance is most important, you can choose to utilize [!UICONTROL on-device decisioning], but when the most relevant and up-to-date experience is needed, a server call can be made instead. See [when to use on-device vs. edge decisioning](../../sdk-guides/on-device-decisioning/supported-features.md) to learn about use cases that warrant using one over the other.

>[!NOTE]
>
>On-device decisioning is available for both client-side as well as server-side implementations. This article describes [!UICONTROL on-device decisioning] for server-side. For information regarding [!UICONTROL on-device decisioning] for client-side, reference the client-side implementation documentation [here](../../../client-side/atjs/on-device-decisioning/on-device-decisioning.md).

## How does it work?

When you install and initialize an [!DNL Adobe Target] SDK with [!UICONTROL on-device decisioning] enabled, a *rule artifact* is downloaded and cached locally on your server, from the Akamai CDN closest to your server. When a request to retrieve an [!DNL Adobe Target] experience is made within your server-side application, the decision regarding which content to return is made in-memory, based on the metadata encoded in the cached rule artifact, which defines all of your [!UICONTROL on-device decisioning] A/B and XT activities.

## How do I provision my client to use [!UICONTROL on-device decisioning]?

On-device decisioning is available for all [!DNL Adobe Target] customers who use [!DNL Adobe Target] server-side SDKs. In order to enable this feature, navigate to **[!UICONTROL Administration]** > **[!UICONTROL Implementation]** > **[!UICONTROL Account details]** in the [!DNL Adobe Target] UI, and enable the **[!UICONTROL On-Device Decisioning]** toggle.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You must have the Admin or Approver *user role* to enable or disable the [!UICONTROL On-Device Decisioning] toggle.

![alt image](assets/asset-odd-toggle.png)

After enabling the On-Device Decisioning toggle, [!DNL Adobe Target] will begin generating and propagating *rule artifacts* for your client.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Ensure you enable the toggle before you initialize the [!DNL Adobe Target] SDK to use [!UICONTROL on-device decisioning]. The rule artifacts will first need to generate and propagate to the Akamai CDNs in order for [!UICONTROL on-device decisioning] to work.

### Include all existing [!UICONTROL on-device decisioning] qualified activities in the artifact toggle

Toggle this **on** when you would like all your live [!DNL Target] activities that qualify for [!UICONTROL on-device decisioning] to be automatically included in the artifact.

Leaving this toggle **off** means you will need to re-create and activate any [!UICONTROL on-device decisioning] activities in order for them to be included in the generated rules artifact.

## How do I know an activity is [!UICONTROL on-device decisioning] capable?

After you create an activity, a label called **[!UICONTROL Decisioning Method]**, visible in the activity detail page, indicates whether the activity is [!UICONTROL on-device decisioning] capable.

![alt image](assets/asset-odd9.png)

You can also see all activities that are [!UICONTROL on-device decisioning] capable on the **[!UICONTROL Activities]** page by adding the column **[!UICONTROL Decisioning Method]** to the list of activities.

![alt image](assets/asset-odd7.png)

>[!NOTE]
>
>After creating and activating an activity that is [!UICONTROL on-device decisioning] capable, it may take up 5-10 minutes before it is included in the rules artifact that is generated and propagated to the Akamai CDN PoPs.

## What is the summary of steps I need to follow to ensure my [!UICONTROL on-device decisioning] activities are delivered successfully via [!DNL Adobe Target]'s server-side SDK?

1. Access the [!DNL Adobe Target] UI and navigate to **[!UICONTROL Administration]** > **[!UICONTROL Implementation]** > **[!UICONTROL Account details]** to enable the **[!UICONTROL On-Device Decisioning]** toggle.
1. Enable the **[!UICONTROL Include all existing [!UICONTROL on-device decisioning] qualified activities in the artifact]** toggle.
1. Create and activate an activity type that is supported by [!UICONTROL on-device decisioning], and verify that the **[!UICONTROL Decisioning Method]** is **[!UICONTROL On-Device Decisioning]** for that activity.
1. Install and initialize the [Node.js](../../node-js/overview.md) or [Java](../../java/overview.md) SDK with `decisioningMethod = on-device`.
1. Implement `getOffers()` or `getAttributes()` in your code to retrieve an experience on-device.
1. Deploy your code.

For examples demonstrating how to get started with steps 1-3 above, see the [Getting started](../getting-started/getting-started.md) section.
