# Profile API settings

Enable or disable authentication for batch updates via [!DNL Adobe Target] APIs and generate a profile authentication token.

[!DNL Adobe Target] creates and maintains a profile for every individual user. This profile is stored on the [!DNL Target] edge cluster and is updated in real time after every visit. You can also update a profile individually or in bulk via API.

For added security, you can require that the Bulk Update API call require a valid access token to be passed in the header of the request.

**To require authentication and to generate an access token using the [!DNL Target] UI:**

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Administration]** > **[!UICONTROL Implementation]**.
1. Under **[!UICONTROL Profile API]** slide the **[!UICONTROL Require Authentication]** toggle to the enabled or disabled position.

   The token expires according to the time listed in the Expires In box.

   You must have one of the following user permissions to generate an authentication token:

   * Admin role or have at least Approver rights

For more information for [!DNL Target Premium] customers, see [Configure enterprise permissions](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/administer/manage-users/enterprise/properties-overview.html).

   * Admin role on the workspace/product profile level

     Workspaces are available to [!DNL Target Premium] customers only. For more information, see [Configure enterprise permissions](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/administer/manage-users/enterprise/properties-overview.html).

   * Admin Rights (Sysadmin permission) on the [!DNL Adobe Target] product level
  
  You can also generate a profile authentication token via API. For more information, see "Profiles" in the [Adobe Target Admin and Profile API guide](../../administer/admin-api/admin-api-overview-new.md).

1. Copy the token and include it in the header of the request in the format: "Authorization" : "Bearer."

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Generate New Profile Authentication Token]** to regenerate the token as needed.
